Whether you're a newcomer or are writing books on the subject, we welcome you. If you're interested in giving a talk or have a talk you'd like someone to give (we'll do our best to find someone qualified), let us know. <p /> This month, we plan to have presentations and discussions around Akka, actors and futures (both Akka's implementation and others). Come join us if you're interested in these topics or others. <p /> Location details can be found on Calagator: <a href="http://calagator.org/events/1250462518">http://calagator.org/events/1250462518</a></p></div>
