<p>Come join fellow Scala hackers and enthusiasts. The guest speaker for this meeting will be Peat Bakke:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><strong>Scala, Circumflex, and MongoDB</strong>
<p>Or, why writing everything from scratch is a great way to learn a language, but a terrible way to be productive.</p>
<p>This is about an ongoing Scala project -- a part of the Capacity product planning and resource management system. We'll be looking at a few parts of the system, a homebrew ORM for MongoDB, and the guts behind the scenes that handles the calculations, and the Circumflex-based JSON web service.</p>
<p>The goal of building these from scratch was to learn, and it continues to be an experiment, so I'm looking forward to everyone's feedback on how to make it better!</p>
