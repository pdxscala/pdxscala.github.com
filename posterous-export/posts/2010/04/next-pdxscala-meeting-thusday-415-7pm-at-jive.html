<p>Come join other Portland, Oregon, Scala enthusiasts at our new  location  graciously hosted by <a href="http://www.jivesoftware.com/">Jive Software</a>. Anything Scala  related is open for  discussion. We'll have <a href="http://twitter.com/hallettj">Jesse Hallett</a> discussing how he  put together a  lambda calculus to learn about Scala's parsing  libraries. <a href="http://twitter.com/pdxleif">Leif  Warner</a> will also be showing an application he's been developing  which uses the  Step web framework (a workalike of the the Sinatra  framework in Ruby). This app uses Simple Build Tool, RDF/OWL, graphs and   federated queues and is intended to provide an "open source community   family tree" of the local Portland-area music scene.</p>
<p>If you  have a project or some code you'd like to share (for review or  just to  look at how you solved an interesting problem) please bring it along.   Pizza will be provided by Jive.</p>
More info, including directions,  is available on <a href="http://calagator.org/events/1250458265">Calagator</a>.</div>
