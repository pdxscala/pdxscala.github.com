<div class='post_body'><a href="http://calagator.org/events/1250459232">http://calagator.org/events/1250459232</a> <p /> Come join fellow Scala hackers and enthusiasts. The guest speaker for <br />this meeting will be Cooper Francis. He's going to cover some of the <br />tricky changes that came in Scala 2.8 (particularly looking at arrays, <br />manifests and implicits) and then do a bit of an exposition of <br />implicits in general and how they can be used to create type classes. <br />This should be a fun talk and I don't doubt we'll all learn something. <br />If any of you have already delved into these changes, please come <br />share your experiences and if you haven't, well... no better time than <br />Thursday night to learn about them! <p /> Once again, our meeting will be at Jive Software, 915 SW Stark St., <br />Suite 400, courtesy of Jesse Hallett, and will be starting at 7PM.</div>
