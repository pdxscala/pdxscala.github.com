<div class='post_body'>It's time, once again, for another chance to meet up with fellow Scala developers and enthusiasts (or even the Scala-curious -- you're welcome, too). We'll be meeting this month at the BankSimple offices, located at 334 NW 11th at 7PM this Thursday, March 17th. <p /> I'll give a brief talk about our experiences building Scala code on top of a Clojure framework and some of the trials and tribulations involved in doing so, and Bryan Armstrong will be talk about "Getting back to deterministic resource release by reimplementing 'disposable' semantics and conditionally verifying client code compliance via phantom reference tracking." <p /> Of course, there will also be time for open discussion and questions, possibly even a brief ad-hoc presentation if someone has something they really want to show off.</div>
