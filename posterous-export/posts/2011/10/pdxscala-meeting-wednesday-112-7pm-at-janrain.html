<p>Come join other Scala enthusiasts to talk about all-things Scala  related. Whether you're a newcomer or are writing books on the subject,  we welcome you. If you're interested in giving a talk or have a talk  you'd like someone to give (we'll do our best to find someone  qualified), let us know.</p>
<p>We don't have any specific talks lined up yet, but there will be interesting discussions, at the very least. That said, there's still plenty of time to put something together if you do want to give a talk. Just drop a note if you have anything in mind.</p>
