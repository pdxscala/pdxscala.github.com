Come join other Scala fans, whether you're a seasoned oldtimer or complete beginner. We'll have open discussions and a variety of presentations and examples. If you have topics you're interested in hearing more about or something you'd like to give a presentation on, please let us know! Also, feel free to bring code you'd like to show off or get input on from the rest of the group!

This month, we'll have [Susan Potter](http://susanpotter.net/) joining us to give a short talk with a couple of motivating examples of Scalaz usage showing how thinking more functionally can yield less complex code. 

As we've been doing for some months now, the first hour of this meeting will be oriented towards people who are relatively new to Scala. If you have questions you'd like to ask about general usage, specific libraries, or overall understanding of the ecosystem, we'll be here to help you find your way. For everyone else, we'll have plenty of extra time tonight for any other discussions and topics, so if you have something you'd like to talk about or code you'd like to show, come prepared! We'll have pizza here at 6, so come early if you're hungry.

We look forward to seeing you all there!

Directions to the Janrain office are available [here](http://calagator.org/events/1250465316).
