Come join other Scala fans, whether you are a seasoned oldtimer or complete beginner. We will have open discussions and a variety of presentations and examples. If you have topics you are interested in hearing more about or something you would like to give a presentation on, please let us know! Also, feel free to bring code you would like to show off or get input on from the rest of the group!

This month, [Susan Potter](http://susanpotter.net/) will be joining us to give a short talk with a couple of motivating examples of Scalaz usage showing how thinking more functionally can yield less complex code. More details on other talks and possible discussion topics will be coming shortly. If you have a topic you would like to discuss or present on, let us know [on the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pdxscala) or ping [@tlockney](https://twitter.com/tlockney) on Twitter. 

Finally, as usual, the first hour of this meeting will be oriented towards people who are relatively new to Scala. If you have questions you would like to ask about general usage, specific libraries, or overall understanding of the ecosystem, we will be here to help you find your way. For everyone else, we will have plenty of extra time tonight for any other discussions and topics. Pizza will be here at 6, so come early if you are hungry.

Directions to the Janrain office are available [here](http://calagator.org/events/1250465316). We look forward to seeing you all there!
